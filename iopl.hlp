The IOPL directive controls whether the system will allow programs
containing IOPL segments to be loaded.  Such segments are used by
programs which access the hardware directly.  System security can be
improved by placing the directive IOPL=NO in CONFIG.SYS.

Directive syntax:	IOPL = YES|NO
			or
			IOPL = pathname[,pathname...]

Default value:		No

Multiple occurrences:	Yes (of second form)

Affects protected mode:	Yes
			
Affects real mode:	No

Example:		IOPL = NO  or  IOPL = C:\OS2\CVP.EXE
